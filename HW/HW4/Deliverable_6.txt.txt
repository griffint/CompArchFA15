My writeup for deliverable 6.

The goal of our decoder is output the readenable signal to the correct decoder. The wires 0-31 of the output bus each go to one of the registers, so I need to set one of the 32 wires to 1. In order to do this, I'm using a bit shift operation with the << operator. This will shift the input enable left, and the magnitude of this shift will be the value of address. If enable is 0, then it doesn't matter how much we shift it by as all of the outputs should be 0 in that case. If enable is 1, then it will be shifted to the correct output wire. For example, if the decoder had 4 outputs and a 2 bit address, an address of 00 would output 0001, an address of 11 would output 1000, an address of 10 would output 0100, and an address of 01 would output 0010. This way, the second output wire will correspond to the second register, and that register will be read enabled. It has an address of 1, so our input address selected it correctly.
